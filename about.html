        <h1>The Beginning</h1>
        <h2>Youth</h2>
        <p>
            Although now a powerful dog with his own legions and territories, Doggus Maximus had humble origins. In fact, he was but one of many strays without a home,
            a raggedy pup--then named Doggus--scrounging for scraps in the dumps behind Denny's. He ran amock with his motley family consisting of the one-legged pigeon Small John,
            a cat that looked like it had been through 'Nam called Able-Ham, and his litter sister--who would later become his most renowned general--Lassy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The merry band's life was like an epic. In merely the first month after meeting each other, they survived the Great Restroom Clog Flood that wiped out the
            neighboring warring ant colonies. Not two months later came the Stoning of Jeremy's Boy Club, where--true to the event's name--the animal troop was stoned whiled the boys
            club was stoned. Then they had barely made it to Doggus's seven-month celebration when were startled by a horrifying giant bear and had to defeat her by launching Small John at the offending
            snout, sending the nosey intruder running. A day later, the bear sent at very offended message to the manager of that night's Denny's, Ben, confusing the poor man who could not decipher
            the honey-laced, dirt-encrusted slobber on the crinkly burger wrapper-turned-letter.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>Tempering</h2>
        <p>
            On the dawn of Doggus's first birthday, Able-Ham took the former to the highest regional vantage point: the top of a local rollercoaster tycoon's mansion. As the two were bathed in
            the red light of morning--one perched precariously on the edge, and the other dangling even more precariously off the edge--Able-Ham recited the Commandments ingrained into him
            by his previous lord, Mega Cattron. Able-Ham then retracted his claws, sending Doggus plummetting down onto a previously well-maintained bush figure of Roller Coaster
            Exhibit 1: The Death Drop. After a few yips and shakes, Doggus righted himself and discovered that Able-Ham was nowhere to be found. Some believe Able-Ham passed the baton from
            Mega Cattron to Doggus; others furiously rebut with, "He was a fookin' asshole."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The sudden betrayal of Able-Ham shook Doggus down to his very bones. Lassy spent days trying to cheer him up, while Small John took over Able-Ham's comfy cardboard box. Two weeks
            later, the Denny's manager stormed out of the franchise. "I've had it! Every damn day I get that god-damned letter with the honey and dirt! You know, all of you jerks know, that
            I'm allergic! To! Dirt! And to top it off, there was a worm in it! Screw you guys! I'll manage my own store, make it better than this one, with blackjack and boba! You'll
            see, you'll all see!" Ben threw his manager hat on the concrete, got in his Lincoln Continental Mark X, and drove off.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Doggus was inspired. <i>"Yes,"</i> he thought to himself. <i>"I'll make my own armies, become my own lord. Able-Ham tried to break me, and he did break my pinky toe. But he
            cannot break my spirit. I will become a great lord, greater than his Mega Cattron, and create my own Commandments focused on fairness instead of jack-assery."</i> Lassy didn't
            know why Ben's departure seemed to invigorate her brother, but whatever. She wagged her tail furiously, creating a draft so strong that Small John could almost attain liftoff.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The remaining three musketeers began a strict training regimen concocted by Doggus. Lassy didn't mind since strength whatever made her brother happy was worth it. Small John
            nearly mutinied in the first hour after Doggus banned eating fries, but was calmed by the promise of a future Land of Plenty. They conquered the Denny's lot, then the abandoned
            Blockbuster front. As they expanded their territory, others became interested in joining. Soon they had multiple squads--all under Doggus's banner--sniffing out lands and
            marking them down. Lassy headed her own crack team, the Crazy Borkers, while Small John retired into a safer, diplomatic role after training up the Dread Bombers.
